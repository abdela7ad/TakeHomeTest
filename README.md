# TakeHomeTest
The goal of this test is to assess your ability to design and develop an iOS application using Swift. The application should interact with a public API, retrieve paginated data, and present the results in a table view.

## Building and running the application
  - minimum  SDK iOS 16
  - The latest XCode will be good

## Any assumptions or decisions made during the test.
   - For filter functionality, I used the API to do the filter so we are requesting a Filter endpoint
